# z/OSMF Workflows App
This is an App that can be used within the Zowe Desktop, and serves two functions: 
1. It allows you to manage workflows from one or more z/OSMF installations, and
2. It is able to make use of workflows that have additional Zowe-specific data which can drive Zowe Apps (via zowe [App to App Communication](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/App-to-App-Communication))

**To request features or report bugs, please use the issues page at the [zlux repo](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues) with the workflow app, or app tags**
